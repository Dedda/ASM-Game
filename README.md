# ASM-Game

To learn the most crucial basics of x86_64 assembly, i decided to write a small text adventure.

For simplicity reasons, this project will only be developed for x86_64 Linux.

## Build

To build, you need the [Netwide Assembler (NASM)](https://www.nasm.us/) aswell as a linker.

The simplest way to compile and link this project to a finished executable is running the `compile.sh` script.

```
$ compile.sh
```
